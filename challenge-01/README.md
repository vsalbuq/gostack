## :rocket: The Challenge

Create an application from scratch to store projects and tasks using [Express](https://expressjs.com).

### Routes

- `POST /projects`: The route must receive `id` and `title` inside the body of the request and store a new project in an array with this shape: `{ id: "1", title: 'New project', tasks: [] }`; Make sure you've sent not only the ID, but also the title of the project, as a double-quoted string.

- `GET /projects`: Rout that lists all projects and their tasks;

- `PUT /projects/:id`: The route must update only the title of the project that has the `id` seen on the parameters of the route;

- `DELETE /projects/:id`: The route must delete the project that has the `id` seen on the parameters of the route;

- `POST /projects/:id/tasks`: The route must receive a field `title` and store a new task in the task array of a specific project, defined by the `id` seen on the parameters of the route;

### Example

If I call `POST /projects` passing `{ id: 1, title: 'New project' }` and the route `POST /projects/1/tasks` with `{ title: 'New task' }`, my project array must be like that:

```js
[
  {
    id: '1',
    title: 'New project',
    tasks: ['New task'],
  },
];
```

### Middlewares

- Create a middleware to be used in all routes that receives the ID of the project in the parameters of the URL to check if there is a project with that ID. If it don't exists, return an error. If it does, allow the request to continue;

- Create a global middleware called in all requests that prints (`console.log`) how many requests were made until now;
